---## Consolidated Insights from Uber Ride Status Dashboard  

### 1. Ride Bookings & Cancellations  
- Out of **150K total bookings**, only **93K completed rides**, giving a **62% success rate**.  
- **25%** of all bookings were cancelled, with **drivers (18%)** cancelling more often than **customers (7%)**.  
- **Customer cancellations** mainly due to wrong addresses, delays, and change of plans.  
- **Driver cancellations** often linked to customer issues, excess passengers, and vehicle-related problems.  

This highlights operational inefficiencies and opportunities to improve **driver allocation & customer communication**.  

---

### 2. Revenue Insights  
- **Total Revenue:** $52M.  
- **UPI** is the dominant payment method, followed by **Cash**, while **Credit/Debit cards** contribute less.  
- Ride distance distribution is fairly balanced, showing consistent demand across short and medium trips.  
- **Top 5 customers alone account for 47.6% of total revenue**, showing strong reliance on a loyal customer base.  

 Growth opportunities lie in **expanding payment adoption (cards/wallets)** and **retaining high-value customers**.  

---

### 3. Customer & Driver Ratings  
- Both **customers and drivers rated Auto rides highest**, making it the most reliable category.  
- **GoAutoMini and GoAutoSedan** also performed strongly, balancing affordability and comfort.  
- **eBike and UberAutoXL** received the lowest ratings, likely due to limited use cases, higher fares, or inconsistent service quality.  
- Ratings between drivers and customers show **similar patterns**, meaning satisfaction is influenced by vehicle type consistently across both groups.  

 Focus should be on **improving service quality in underperforming vehicle types** and **maintaining strong performance in Auto & Sedan categories**.  

---

###  Overall Takeaway  
The **Uber Ride Status Dashboard** provides a **360° operational view**, covering bookings, cancellations, revenue, and satisfaction metrics.  

Key themes:  
- **Operational Challenge:** High driver cancellations reduce service reliability.  
- **Financial Performance:** Revenue is strong but heavily reliant on UPI payments and a small group of loyal customers.

- Enhance service quality across vehicle types.
